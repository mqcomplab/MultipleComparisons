# MultipleComparisons

# About
MultipleComparisons allows to calculate and process extended (e.g., n-ary) similarity indices.
The basic theory is detailed in: "Extended similarity indices: the benefits of comparing more than two objects simultaneously. Part 1: Theory and characteristics", R. A. Miranda-Quintana, D. Bajusz, A. Rácz, K. Héberger; J. Cheminformatics (in preparation)

# Usage
The folder indices contains the classes used to process to calculate the n-ary indices.
The folder post_processing contains auxiliary functionality that can be used to process the results (generating files with the results of the
comparisons, sum of rankind differences, preparation of input files for ANOVA analysis).
